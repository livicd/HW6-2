    <h1>Homework 6 pt 2 - Olivia Dagenhart</h1>
    <h2>Explanation of the Ratio</h2>
    <h3>I chose to look at the ratio of people with health insurance compared to the total population of a county. This ratio is more useful than a simple count because it takes into account the difference in population between different counties. I chose to do the ratio per 100 people because I thought that would make it less technical, and the numbers would be easier to understand. However, I left decimals in the legend because I wanted to be as specific as possible. </h3>
